Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...
I had these dreaded feelings...
That I might be dealing...
With something so challenging, it might leave my eyes all teary...
But instead of crying in worry...
I decided to take a prayer by kneeling...
Asking God for strength, I ask how do I do this...
The voice I heard said, "My son, have faith in your dealings..."
"You have nothing to worry about, have grace.
Have faith and you shall have the strength to get through the trials that are fiery..."
I said, "But why can't things be easy? Why can't it be given?"
The voice expressed: "Because character is never static... it is always evolving!
Do not be leery, give yourself great feelings, for you are worthy, please keep on dreaming..."
I said: I am grateful... I am worthy... I am a coder through faith, now I carry myself happy and cheery.
I get up... Look up and march to _victory_.
